<p>Phenotype-based screening of small molecules is the basis of modern drug discovery. However, hit rates from these screens are typically too low to permit identification of common chemical or structural themes among the identified compounds. Importantly, screening is done either in vitro using high-throughput phenotyping, or in model organisms that have either very limited relevance to vertebrate biology or are not amenable to automated phenotyping. Here, a small library of 4,182 bio reactive compounds was manually screened in live zebrafish recording over one thousand compound-phenotype associations spanning an array of 10 distinct developmental phenotypes. In this project we tested the hypothesis that a machine learning framework can predict phenotypes of unknown compounds based to their physical and structural properties. Furthermore, using independent screening data from human cancer cells we tested the idea that our model could help to predict the toxic side effects of unknown cancer drugs. If successful, this method will be suitable for prioritizing much larger libraries (e.g. consisting of millions of compounds) for specific phenotypic classes that are relevant to human physiology.</p>

<p>Unexpected toxic side effects are a major problem in drug development. Historical data show that nearly 90% of drug withdrawal cases were caused by severe toxic effects, among which the majority were associated with cardiovascular symptoms. As an example, in 2004, rofecoxib (Vioxx), Merckâ€™s blockbuster anti-inflammatory drug was removed from the market because of increased risk of heart attack and stroke. As another example, propulsid (Cisapride), an oral drug to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), was associated with over 400 adverse cardiac events (arrhythmias) resulting in more than 80 deaths in the USA. It was removed from the US market in 2000. Other well-known drugs that were withdrawn due to toxic effects include the antihistamine terfenadine and the antibacterial grepafloxacin. Considering an average development cost of almost $1.8 billion and approximately 8.5 years of effort to bring a new drug to market, late-stage withdrawals mean significant losses to the pharmaceutical industry. The high cost of failure is also an important cause for the continuous decline in the number of new drugs that have entered the market over the past 10 years. Therefore, new methods are needed that can identify serious adverse effects during early stage of drug development.</p>
